### Registers
{: .pt-4 .border-bottom }

- There are sixteen general-purpose registers, and the lower 32 bits, 16 bits, and 8 bits of each register are addressable.
- The higher 8 bits of `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx` and `rdx` can be referred to as, `ah`, `bh`, `ch` and `dh`.
- Eight 80-bit floating point `FPRn` which are overlaid with 64-bit MMX registers `MMXn`. 
- Sixteen 128-bit XMM registers `XMMn`.
- A 64-bit `RFLAGS` register. The higher 32 bits of `RFLAGS` are reserved and unused.
- A 64-bit `rip` register.
- The segment registers `cs`, `fs` and `gs`.
- `rax`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rbx`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `rbp`, `rsp` are aliases to registers `r0` to `r7`.
- `rax`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8`, `r9`, `r10`, `r11` are considered volatile (caller-saved).
- `rbx`, `rdi`, `rsi`, `rbp`, `rsp`, `r12`, `r13`, `r14`, and `r15` are considered nonvolatile (callee-saved).

### RFLAGS Register
{: .pt-4 .border-bottom }

The RFLAGS register stores flags used for results of operations and for controlling the processor.

{: .table .table-sm .small .table-borderless }
| Mnemonic | Bit | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | :--- |
| `CF` | 0 | Carry | Operation generated a carry or borrow |
| `PF` | 2 | Parity | Last byte has even number of 1's, else 0 |
| `AF` | 4 | Adjust | Denotes binary coded decimal in-byte carry |
| `ZF` | 6 | Zero | Result was 0 |
| `SF` | 7 | Sign | Most significant bit of result is 1 |
| `OF` | 11 | Overflow | Overflow on signed operation |
| `DF` | 10 | Direction | Direction string instructions operate (increment or decrement) |
| `ID` | 21 | Identification | Changeability denotes presence of `cpuid` instruction |

### Application Binary Interface
{: .pt-4 .border-bottom }

- [Application Binary Interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf)
- [Overview of x64 ABI conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-software-conventions?view=msvc-170)

__Linux__

- In user-level applications, the first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, `r9`.
- In kernel mode the interface is `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `r10`, `r8`, `r9`.
- Integer return values up to 64 bits in size are stored in `rax`, while values up to 128 bit are stored in `rax` and `rdx`.
- The number of the syscall has to be passed in register `rax`.
- A system-call is done via the `syscall` instruction. The kernel destroys registers `rcx` and `r11`.
- Returning from the `syscall`, register `rax` contains the result of the system-call. A value in the range between 
`-4095` and `-1` indicates an error, it is `-errno`.
- The stack pointer `rsp` must be aligned to a 16-byte boundary before making a call.

__Windows__

- In user-level applications, the first four integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8`, `r9`.
- In kernel mode the interface is `r10`, `rdx`, `r8`, `r9`.
- For floating point arguments, the first four arguments are passed in registers `xmm0`, `xmm1`, `xmm2`, `xmm3`.
- Additional arguments are pushed on the stack left to right.
- It is the caller’s responsibility to allocate 32 bytes of “shadow space” (for storing `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8`, `r9` if needed) before calling a function.
- It is the caller’s responsibility to clean the stack after a call.
- The stack is 16-byte aligned. The call instruction pushes an 8-byte return value, All non-leaf functions must adjust the stack by a value of the form 16n+8 when allocating stack space.

### Jump
{: .pt-4 .border-bottom }

The jump instructions allow the programmer to (indirectly) set the value of the `rip` register, with
all of the jump instructions, with the exception of `jmp`, being conditional jumps.

| `jrcxz` | | `rcx` = 0 | Jump if counter register is zero |

### Move
{: .pt-4 .border-bottom }

{: .table .table-sm .small .table-borderless }
| Mnemonic | Description |
| --- | :---: |
| `mov`    | |
| `movzbw` | Byte to word; zero-extended. |
| `movzbl` | Byte to long; zero-extended. |
| `movzwl` | Word to long; zero-extended. |
| `movsxd` | Word to long; sign-extension. |

### Test
{: .pt-4 .border-bottom }

The `test` instruction performs a bitwise AND on two operands.

- The flags `SF`, `ZF`, `PF` are modified while the result of the AND is discarded.
- The `OF` and `CF` flags are set to 0, while `AF` flag is undefined.
- The `test` operation clears the flags `CF` and `OF` to zero.
- The `SF` is set to the most significant bit of the result of the AND. If the result is 0, the `ZF` is set to 1, otherwise set to 0.
